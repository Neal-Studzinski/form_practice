 -It's not in the form image anywhere, but include a "submit" button for the user to submit their form

 -When the user submits their form, you should run a function that validates their input.

 -If their input is invalid, you must somehow inform the user that they need to fill out more information. You can be very generic in this message.

 -If their input is valid, put the input in an object and print that object to the console.
